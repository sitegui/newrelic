Idiomatic Rust bindings to the New Relic C SDK.

Note: versions 0.1.0 onwards of this crate are completely incompatible
with previous versions as they move away from the deprecated New Relic SDK
to the newer New Relic C SDK. This has additional requirements: see
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/c-sdk/get-started/introduction-c-sdk
for details.
